# FabRISC ISA

This the official repository for the FabRISC project.

FabRISC is an open-source, modular, RISC-like instruction set architecture for 32 and 64 bit microprocessors. Some features of this specifications are:

* variable length instructions of 2, 4 and 6 bytes.
* scalar and vector capabilities.
* atomic and transactional memory support.
* privileged architecture.
* and more!

### Compiling from source

This repository holds the LaTeX source code for the specification. The steps to compile are very simple and all is necessary is to compile the "FabRISC_spec.tex" file in the "./src" folder with PDFLaTeX to generate the PDF document.

#### Disclaimer

This is just a personal project used as a learning experience so don't expect anything ground breaking, however any kind of feedback is absolutely welcome and needed!
